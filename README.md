# Mihir-Portfolio
Welcome to my professional portfolio. I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for crafting seamless, user-friendly web applications. With a strong foundation in UI/UX design and Android development, I create digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.

My portfolio showcases a wide range of projects, from responsive websites and real-time chat applications to IoT-based systems and community management tools. I combine creative thinking with technical expertise to deliver solutions that solve real-world problems.

Whether it's front-end interfaces built with React and Tailwind CSS or robust back-end logic using Node.js and MongoDB, every project reflects my commitment to clean code, intuitive design, and performance optimization.

Letâ€™s build something impactful together.
